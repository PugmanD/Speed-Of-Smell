            Have you ever heard that very interesting sound coming from the 
            backend of another human being? Well not to be vulgar, but that's 
            called a fart&dash;which is a mixture of 59% nitrogen, 21% hydrogen, 9% 
            carbon dioxide, 7% methane and 4% oxygen, but that is not the point.
            The point is have you ever wondered how long it will take the "stench" 
            to get to you? Well for your entertainment we hired a group of scientist 
            to figure out the actual statistics and it turned out that it is extremly 
            diffucult question to find an answer to.
